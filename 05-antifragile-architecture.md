### Abstract

Unlike traditional platforms that break under pressure, Donafi is built to be antifragile. Our multi-chain architecture, non-custodial smart contracts, and decentralized storage ensure that the platform cannot be shut down, censored, or co-opted.

We rely on code, not corporations. By removing the central point of control, we remove the central point of failure. This architecture provides "bank-grade" security with the transparency and resilience of a global blockchain network.
