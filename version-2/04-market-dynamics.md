### Abstract

A perfect storm of forces is driving the market toward decentralized solutions. Trust in centralized institutions is collapsing, blockchain infrastructure has finally matured to support mainstream UX, and geopolitical fragmentation is creating demand for sovereign financial tools.

Donafi is positioned to capture this converging market demand. We are entering the market at the exact moment where the pain of centralization exceeds the friction of adoption for decentralized alternatives.
