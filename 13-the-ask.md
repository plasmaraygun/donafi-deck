### Abstract

We are raising $1.5M in Seed funding to finalize the MVP, secure legal frameworks, and launch our go-to-market campaign. This capital provides 18 months of runway to reach profitability and prove the model at scale.

This is an opportunity to invest in the base layer of the new charitable economy. You aren't just funding a company; you are funding the infrastructure for a more free and inclusive financial future.
