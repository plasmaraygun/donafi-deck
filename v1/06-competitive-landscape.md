### Abstract

Donafi enters a blue ocean with no direct competitors in decentralized P2P crowdfunding. Traditional platforms are shackled by legacy banking and censorship, while crypto-native solutions are either B2B focused or lack user-friendly interfaces for mainstream adoption.

We bridge this gap. By combining the censorship resistance of DeFi with the user experience of Web2, we capture the best of both worlds—providing a superior product for our target users that incumbents simply cannot replicate.
