### Abstract

We are executing a phased rollout: MVP on Ethereum/L2s for security, followed by multi-chain expansion for low costs, and finally a fully decentralized mobile app for mass adoption. Each phase reduces friction and increases censorship resistance, building toward an unstoppable global platform.

Our roadmap prioritizes security and resilience above all else. We are building financial rails that must withstand adversarial environments, so we rigorously audit and stress-test every component before scaling.
