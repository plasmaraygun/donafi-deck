### Abstract

Donafi represents a once-in-a-generation infrastructure opportunity at the intersection of the $250B+ crowdfunding market and the urgent need for censorship-resistant financial rails. We offer a strategic hedge against geopolitical fragmentation and platform risk, combining platform economics with a unique regulatory arbitrage strategy.

Our thesis is simple: as the world becomes more fragmented and centralized platforms more restrictive, the value of neutral, unstoppable financial infrastructure increases exponentially. Donafi is positioned to capture this value.
